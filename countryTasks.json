This initiative began with a Red Cross-led assessment process in which communities themselves identified the most significant risks they face and the actions they can take to mitigate them. Some examples of community interventions include strengthening water and sanitation systems, delivering key messages about health promotion and disease prevention, and training and equipping community members with first aid skills and supplies. In addition to addressing specific hazards, another key program component is working with communities so they are able to self-organize and self-manage advocacy or education efforts that will help them be better prepared for future disasters.
