     desc: Help us map the infrastructure of Kharkiv. Using current high-resolution imagery, we will digitize roads, buildings, sidewalks, and crosswalks within the city – helping to further complete a free and open map dataset of Kharkiv. OpenStreetMap will be used as the platform to digitize, store, and share such critical data for usage by first responders, planners and geospatial enthusiasts. Kharkiv is the Eastern European location selected for the Department of State's Secondary Cities Initiative. Secondary Cities projects are also being implemented in five other locations worldwide in Peru, Colombia, Nepal, Ethiopia, and Indonesia. Secondary Cities is the United States Office of the Geographer’s flagship field-based initiative to assist rapidly growing cities to build capacity for data generation for resiliency, human security, and emergency preparedness. The main activities under this initiative in Kharkiv are being led by the Association of American Geographers.
