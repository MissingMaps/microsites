    desc: MSF has started a nutritional programme in the southern part of Maiduguri, Borno state, Nigeria). More than one million internally displaced persons (IDPs) have been identified in Maiduguri alone, doubling the host population. Where MSF is providing care alone, there are approximately 227 000 IDPs. They are difficult to identify and reach. MSF targets the dense areas (more buildings = more population) as people there are more vulnerable to malnutrition and transmittable diseases. As MSFis new to the area, a more detailed map would allow surveillance teams to advance faster in order to facilitate food distribution.
