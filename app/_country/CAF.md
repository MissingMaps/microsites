    desc: The region of Bangassou was affected by violence in March 2013. In order to allow access to secondary health care in the region of Bangassou, MSF has started supporting HRUB (Hopital RÃ©gional Universitaire de Bangassou) since February 2014. From early 2015, it will increase its action to primary health care and support some periphery health centers. For more information on the Missing Maps, visit www.missingmaps.org.
