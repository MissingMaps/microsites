     desc: <p>The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate preemptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.</p> MSF has a team working to eliminate Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT, or Sleeping Sickness) in 6 countries.  The disease has been nearly eliminated, but remains in hidden pockets where healthcare has been severely lacking, where it continues to cause avoidable suffering and death.  In order to find the last pockets of this awful disease, MSF teams travel all over the affected region, screening for cases of HAT, which is transmitted by tsetse flies near rivers.  To help the team find these pockets, we need to map the population (houses) and rivers.  Also of interest are "gallery forests", where there are significant patches of trees directly adjacent to rivers; these are prime tsetse fly habitat.

     desc: The region of Bangassou was affected by violence in March 2013. In order to allow access to secondary health care in the region of Bangassou, MSF has started supporting HRUB (Hopital RÃ©gional Universitaire de Bangassou) since February 2014. From early 2015, it will increase its action to primary health care and support some periphery health centers. <p>The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises).
