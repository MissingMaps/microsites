     desc: Crocker Range National Park was established in 1984. It covers the north-south Crocker Range, of 1200-1800 metre mountains in Sabah, Malaysia. The boundaries of the park have been surveyed, but no facilities exist at present for visitors. The park covers 1,399 kmÂ², making it the largest park in Sabah. The park consists of both hill and montane forest, with many species of flora and fauna endemic to Borneo. Maintenance of this forest cover is essential to ensuring a pure water supply for many of the towns and communities in Sabah.
