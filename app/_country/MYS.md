     desc: The George Washington University, with support from with GFDRR, the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, and other partners,  have created a system that combines machine learning and Forecast-based Financing to effectively integrate information, decisions, and consequences. When upstream rainfall and reservoir levels indicate that inundation downstream is likely, a message is automatically transmitted to the local Red Cross, who can release funds from the Forecast-based Financing system to activate preparedness measures before the flood hits.
