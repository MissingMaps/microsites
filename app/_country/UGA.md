     desc: An escalation of violence in South Sudan since July 2016 has lead to a large population movement into the north of neighboring Uganda. An estimated rate of between 2,000 and 3,000 displaced persons cross the border into Uganda each day. In a rapidly developing situation such as this, it is vital that accurate and up-to-date mapping information is available to allow the ERU to respond more effectively and efficiently. The maps that you create in this task will enable sanitation facilities - including latrines, hand washing points and hygiene promotion activities - to be effectively provisioned for the people living there.
