    desc: MSF are starting an HIV testing campaign (and also TB and malaria) in Uganda. The campaign will be implemented sequentially in landing sites bordering the lakes George, Edward and the Kazinga Channel. It is important to know whether the testing adequately covers the population and for that MSF teams need to know how many people live in the area. Mapping the area to the building level will show how many houses there are in the various sites and from this, a population estimate can be obtained.
