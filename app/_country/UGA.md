     desc: MSF are starting an HIV testing campaign (and also TB and malaria) in Uganda. The campaign will be implemented sequentially in landing sites bordering the lakes George, Edward and the Kazinga Channel. It is important to know whether the testing adequately covers the population and for that MSF teams need to know how many people live in the area. Mapping the area to the building level will show how many houses there are in the various sites and from this, a population estimate can be obtained. <p>The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.</p>
