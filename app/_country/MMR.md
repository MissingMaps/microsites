     desc: The Red Cross is mapping the Ayeyarwady Delta area in Myanmar as part of a multi-year mapping and data readiness activity to better understand where critical infrastructure and roads are to inform decision making during potential disasters. As recently as 2008 a cyclone killed at least 77,000 people with over 55,900 missing, and left about 2.5 million homeless. The map data will help the Red Cross to better understand where people live in relation to potential hazards so that we can help them be prepared for the disaster and so national decision makers can make better decisions in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of the U.S. Department of State is providing the OpenStreetMap community access to updated satellite imagery services to help assist with humanitarian mapping.

     desc: The main objective of this work is to digitize all the buildings footprints starting in the priority area of Hakha City (Capital of Chin State), then expand it to the rest of the area in Chin State. The building footprints data are needed as one of the exposure/element at risk data that are required for multi-hazard risk assessment of Chin State, Myanmar. This is part of a program which is aiming “to contribute to #improving disaster preparedness and reducing risks for all people in Chin State.”  Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of the U.S. Department of State is providing the OpenStreetMap community access to updated satellite imagery services to help assist with humanitarian mapping.
