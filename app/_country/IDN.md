     desc: On the 2nd July 2013 a magnitude 6.2 earthquake occurred in Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam Province, Northern Sumatra, Indonesia, as reported by BMKG. The death toll exceeded 40 and many buildings were destroyed and many more damaged. The affected area is rural with some larger towns exposed and twelve villages in the worst impacted area. Earthquake shaking intensities peaked at MMI VIII (severe shaking). The damage illustrates the significant earthquake risk that exists in Indonesia that is driven by high earthquake hazard, large human exposure and very vulnerable construction types. While devastating, this event provides a valuable opportunity to gather information on Indonesian building types and their performance in severe earthquakes.

     desc: This project is set up as part of the A Missing Maps party to support the newly launched Map for Environment platform, funded by the World Resource Institute. The aim of the event is to map and capture the location and extent of deforestation in OpenStreetMap for areas in Indonesia during OSM Geo Week. This stunning archipelago has the world's 3rd largest tropical rainforest, but is sadly ranked 2nd for deforestation. Half of Sumatra's forest cover disappeared from 1985 to 2008, and 90% of oil plantation in Kalimantan from 1990-2010 came at the expense of forest cover. This project was initiated by the devastating 2015 fires in Kalimantan that were linked to deforestation, and the desire of the Green School students in Bali to assist their neighbours.
