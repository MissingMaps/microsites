    desc: MSF HIV-SGBV Rustenburg Project operates in the Platinum Mining Belt. The project consists primarily of care and service provision for victims of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV), particularly critical in this region. MSF services various informal settlements along the platinum mining belt, however very little spatial information is available about the characteristics of SGBV incidence and demographics, and basic services availability amongst these different settlements. This mapping will be a powerful help to improve efficiency of MSF daily activities, deepen our understanding of access to basic services, and act as a support layer to further GIS analysis of SGBV incidents to better match future activities with ground needs.
