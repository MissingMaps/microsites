     desc: The Kyrgyz Republic is located in a region of high seismic hazard. In addition, the typical buildings in the region are susceptible to damage from seismic hazards (e.g. earthquake ground shaking). The population in the region is therefore exposed to the combination of high seismic hazards and vulnerable building stock.  This World Bank-supported project aims to collect exposure data on buildings and infrastructure that will be used in a nationwide seismic risk assessment study. The project is held in conjunction with key government agencies and local university departments in Kyrgyz Republic, which will help ground truth the OSM data created through volunteer remote mapping.
