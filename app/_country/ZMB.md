     desc: The Peace Corps public health program in Zambia is requesting assistance in creating a base map for the town of Mukonchi. The local health clinic will use the map data to better visualize the limits of their catchment area and for improved navigation to home-based care and emergency care patients.

     desc: The Kagunda community health committee in collaboration with Peace Corps Zambia, is requesting assistance to inventory buildings and roads for malaria prevention programs.  Kagunda is a community of over 6,000 people and is known to have the highest rate of Malaria in Chipata District,  Eastern Province,  Zambia. As a community health committee, it is our intention to track and monitor the rates of Malaria per individual village but also the tracking and monitoring of prevention.  From bed net checks to IRS (Indoor Residual Spraying), we hope to keep a visual record and by doing so promote accountability and adherence for the safety and well being of our community.

     desc: The Peace Corps Public Health program in Zambia and the Manyaana health clinic are requesting assistance building a better base map of Manyaana. The health clinic will use the base map data to gain a clearer understanding of the needs of their catchment zone and to conduct basic public health analyses. In addition, the Forest Department will use the data while managing the 1,000 hectare forest reserve in the community.

     desc: OSM Zambia in collaboration with Lusaka City Council and the Department of Physical Planning and Housing, under the Ministry of Local Government want to carry out a geospatial survey to provide evidence and spatial data for the improvement and upgrading of unplanned settlements. Misisi was identified as a pilot area to prove that OpenStreetMap is a suitable tool for local authorities to gather socio and spatial information’s.

     desc: In Lusaka, around 1.2 million people live in overcrowded ‘informal settlements’ that are at risk of cholera each rainy season. In 2016, the rainy season was delayed, causing boreholes to dry up and forcing the population to use unprotected shallow wells. When the rains came, floodwaters mixed with overfull pit latrines, creating rivers and lakes of contaminated water that people were forced to wade through. This created the ideal environment for cholera and a significant outbreak did occur. This project supports the local OSM community working with a multiple NGOs response to the cholera crisis and the Lusaka civil authorities efforts to bring improved sanitation services to the people of Lusaka.

     desc: This mapping project is to understand the layout of the community and assist in the upcoming mass distribution of mosquito nets in Zambia. This would also serve as a resource in visually understanding contributing factors to outbreaks of diarrheal diseases and high malaria cases. Once created, this map will serve as a basemap for the region and aid the Peace Corps Public Health program in Zambia.

     desc: OSM Zambia in collaboration with the Ministry of Local Government want to carry out geospatial surveys, in order to support Local Authorities to set-up GIS based Land Information Systems. The digitalization and creation of reliable spatial data is therefore the first step. These information is needed in order to make the correct development decisions on the quantum and location of services and facilities.

     desc: Songwe region in western Tanzania has a high incidence of extreme poverty, early marriage and Gender Based Violence. NGOs on the ground need better road and residential area data to facilitate their outreach work. The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.
