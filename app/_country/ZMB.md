    desc: Validation is still needed! In Lusaka, around 1.2 million people live in overcrowded ‘informal settlements’ that are at risk of cholera each rainy season. In 2016, the rainy season was delayed, causing boreholes to dry up and forcing the population to use unprotected shallow wells. When the rains came, floodwaters mixed with overfull pit latrines, creating rivers and lakes of contaminated water that people were forced to wade through. This created the ideal environment for cholera and a significant outbreak did occur. This project supports the local OSM community working with a multiple NGOs response to the cholera crisis and the Lusaka civil authorities efforts to bring improved sanitation services to the people of Lusaka.
