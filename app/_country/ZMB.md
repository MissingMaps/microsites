     desc: Pweto has been partially mapped through another HOT project, but to conduct effective epidemiology, building level data is needed, and a lot of neighbourhoods in Pweto are lacking in this area. Please help us complete the tracing of buildings and residential roads, so that the data can be used by MSF teams when disease outbreaks occur.

     desc: Small urgent project - Close buildings, just be careful mapping, read instructions Validated outside of the Tasking Manager - all squares should be considered green OSM Zambia in collaboration with Lusaka City Council and the Department of Physical Planning and Housing, under the Ministry of Local Government want to carry out a geospatial survey to provide evidence and spatial data for the improvement and upgrading of unplanned settlements. Misisi was identified as a pilot area to prove that OpenStreetMap is a suitable tool for local authorities to gather socio and spatial information’s.

     desc: OSM Zambia has asked to map the remainder of this critical area. This is the last project for this area! In Lusaka, around 1.2 million people live in overcrowded ‘informal settlements’ that are at risk of cholera each rainy season. In 2016, the rainy season was delayed, causing boreholes to dry up and forcing the population to use unprotected shallow wells. When the rains came, floodwaters mixed with overfull pit latrines, creating rivers and lakes of contaminated water that people were forced to wade through. This created the ideal environment for cholera and a significant outbreak did occur. This project supports the local OSM community working with a multiple NGOs response to the cholera crisis and the Lusaka civil authorities efforts to bring improved sanitation services to the people of Lusaka.

     desc: This project is to trace buildings, and missing major roads, in this region of Zambia. This project may require using and adjusting multiple imagery sources. Your mapping contribution will help prevent the suffering and loss of life the disease malaria causes.
