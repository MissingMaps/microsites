    desc: Just needs validating MSF teams are fighting an epidemic of yellow fever in Kinshasa, DRC. This involves two major activities. One is a massive vaccination of 3 health zones (Byiela, Kikimi and Kingasani), including multiple vaccination sites, access planning, monitoring and mapping.  The second activity is the fumigation / destruction of mosquito larvae and eggs (as mosquitos spread the disease). This involves a strong spatial element because fumigation needs to take place within 100m of each confirmed yellow fever case. Mapping will go a long way to facilitate all of this work.
