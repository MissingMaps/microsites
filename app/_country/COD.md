     desc: Lubumbashi has been partially mapped at the request of MSF to help the organisation respond to the frequent disease outbreaks that hit the city. Missing Maps / HOT and the OSM lubumbashi group have completed the field mapping, so that MSF can use the data in outbreak surveillance and response. To conduct effective epidemiology, building level data is needed, and while Lubumbashi is very well mapped, a lot of neighbourhoods are lacking in this area. Please help us complete the tracing, so that the data can be used in the coming weeks. The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.

     desc: This task is part of a Missing Maps initiative to add data collected in the field in a variety of formats to OSM. Updating the basemap with highways and residential areas from Bing imagery is required as part of the workflow. Once this task is completed, mappers will digitise data from maps supplied by MSF in the field. This area in Katanga, Congo (DRC) sees frequent, large-scale medical interventions from local MSF teams.

     desc: The Democratic Republic of Congo is a priority country for the Missing Maps project. South Kivu is a province of DRC that, for decades, has faced unceasing humanitarian crises. With constantly changing conflicts, seasonal disease epidemics and a population in constant flux, MSF and other NGOs have permanent presences here.  There is no freely available mapping data available for the province, aside from that which has been already generously contributed by the HOT community in response to very specific crises. The Missing Maps has launched the Map South Kivu project to map the entire province, both remotely and through local community mapping. See here for a video introduction to mapping South Kivu.

     desc: Médecins Sans Frontière is working in Bunia, RDC, a fast growing city (capital of the province) on preventing cholera crises and security issues. In order to help them make the best decisions possible, having the most accurate overview of everything related to roads and buildings in these areas would be an invaluable asset.

     desc: Validation needed! Please validate residential areas and road networks! MSF teams, in collaboration with the Congolese Ministry of Health, provide care for thousands of people in Masisi General Hospital and other health centres in the area, including the provision of HIV care. MSF also organises mobile clinics, which respond to the needs of people affected by violence, insecurity and poor access to healthcare, some of whom have have been forced to flee their homes. Mapping this area will help MSF to identify vulnerable populations, plan and manage medical interventions and provide better care for those displaced by violence.

     desc: Only for intermediate mappers, JOSM users In the beginning of March, after the request made by the International Committee of the Red Cross, CartONG and the Missing Maps project started mapping Goma in DRC. This city was weakened by various crisis that the country endured for the last 20 years, the city also grew a lot due to a strong demographic growth in the last 10 years.
