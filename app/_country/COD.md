   - desc: Lulimba is a small, remote town located in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Just last year the region hosted more than 800,000 displaced people escaping violence elsewhere.They are often left vulnerable to disease, malnutrition, and war-related injuries. The widespread outbreaks of cholera and measles, and providing treatment for patients with tuberculosis and HIV remain the main challenges facing health workers.

   - desc: The region of Bangassou was affected by violence in March 2013. In order to allow access to secondary health care in the region of Bangassou, MSF has started supporting HRUB (Hopital Régional Universitaire de Bangassou) since February 2014. From early 2015, it will increase its action to primary health care and support some periphery health centers.

   - desc: South Kivu is a cholera endemic area. But in Bukavu, a city of one million inhabitants on the banks of Lake Kivu, there are also many factors favouring the spread of the disease. a large part of the population doesn’t have access to good quality water due to the poor infrastructure; the rainy season, which is when the disease spreads, lasts for nine months; and the hygiene habits of the population are not adequate,” explains Juan Matías, coordinator of MSF’s emergency teams in DRC, following the 2014 outbreak in which MSF teams treated 690 people for cholera.

   - desc: The Democratic Republisc of Congo is a priority country for the Missing Maps project. South Kivu is a province of DRC that, for decades, has faced unceasing humanitarian crises. With constantly changing conflicts, seasonal disease epidemics and a population in constant flux, MSF and other NGOs have permanent presences here.  There is no freely available mapping data available for the province, aside from that which has been already generously contributed by the HOT community in response to very specific crises. The Missing Maps has launched the Map South Kivu project to map the entire province, both remotely and through local community mapping.

   - desc: The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a high priority country for the Missing Maps project. For decades, eastern DRC, where South Kivu is situated, has experienced armed conflict, political instability, and serious health crises. Armed militias loot and attack villages whilst a host of health complications, including malnutrition and neglected tropical diseases, go untreated. Although MSF and other NGOs have been providing humanitarian assistance to the population, there is still a great need for the communities to have better access to healthcare, education, and livelihoods. By helping to map South Kivu, you will play a direct role in facilitating this. The aim of this task is to map the entire province of South Kivu, both remotely and through local community mapping. This task is part of the Missing Maps Project, whose objective is to pre-emptively map vulnerable countries to support ongoing humanitarian projects and improve disaster response, medical activities, and resource allocation when crises occur.  <strong>Thank you for contributing.</strong>

In order to support an upcoming MSF measles vaccination programme, we need to fill in the gaps by mapping residential areas, roads, and major waterways in these areas. Please help us complete the mapping so that the data can be used for the upcoming MSF programme as well as for future outbreak surveillance and response.

Missing Maps / HOT will be running training for volunteers in Lubumbashi (starting on the 17th July) to help complete the field mapping, so that MSF can use the data in outbreak surveillance and response. To conduct effective epidemiology, building level data is needed, and while Lubumbashi is very well mapped, a lot of neighbourhoods are lacking in this area. Please help us complete the tracing, so that the data can be used in the coming weeks.

The second activity is the fumigation / destruction of mosquito larvae and eggs (as mosquitos spread the disease). This involves a strong spatial element because fumigation needs to take place within 100m of each confirmed yellow fever case. Mapping will go a long way to facilitate all of this work.

   - desc: Validators, please validate residential areas and road networks! MSF teams, in collaboration with the Congolese Ministry of Health, provide care for thousands of people in Masisi General Hospital and other health centres in the area, including the provision of HIV care. MSF also organises mobile clinics, which respond to the needs of people affected by violence, insecurity and poor access to healthcare, some of whom have have been forced to flee their homes. Mapping this area will help MSF to identify vulnerable populations, plan and manage medical interventions and provide better care for those displaced by violence.

   - desc: Manono has been partially mapped through another HOT project, but to conduct effective epidemiology, building level data is needed, and a lot of neighbourhoods in Manono are lacking in this area. Please help us complete the tracing of buildings and residential roads, so that the data can be used by MSF teams. This area of Katanga sees frequent disease outbreaks and the MSF Katanga Emergency Response Unit has identified it as a priority area for mapping.

   - desc: MSF&#39;s South Kivu emergency response unit will be conducting a vaccination campaign on the island of Idjwi in South Kivu, Congo (DRC). They will begin in one week and accurate digital maps will assist them in making sure they get sufficient coverage to halt the progress of the disease. The Democratic Republic of Congo is a priority country for the Missing Maps project. South Kivu is a province of DRC that, for decades, has faced unceasing humanitarian crises. With constantly changing conflicts, seasonal disease epidemics and a population in constant flux, many international NGOs have permanent presences here.

   - desc: MSF teams are fighting an epidemic of yellow fever in Kinshasa, DRC. This involves two major activities. One is a massive vaccination of 3 health zones (Byiela, Kikimi and Kingasani), including multiple vaccination sites, access planning, monitoring and mapping.  The second activity is the fumigation / destruction of mosquito larvae and eggs (as mosquitos spread the disease). This involves a strong spatial element because fumigation needs to take place within 100m of each confirmed yellow fever case. Mapping will go a long way to facilitate all of this work.
