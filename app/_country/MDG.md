     desc: The Bed Net Surveillance Program is a Peace Corps Madagascar initiative. The goal of the program is to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality in participating communities by encouraging community members to regularly use mosquito nets. The Bed Net Surveillance Program will monitor LLIN (Long Lasting Insecticide-treated Nets) usage through the help of GIS (Geographic Information System) based technologies. Community leaders will focus sensitization efforts on households that do not routinely sleep under mosquito nets in order to achieve high bednet coverage rates.

     desc: This project is for more intermediate and advanced mappers This is post-event imagery provided by DigitalGlobe On Tuesday, March 7th, a Cyclone Enawo with windspeeds equivalent to that of a category 4 hurricane, made landfall in the north east of Madagascar. This is the strongest cyclone that has impacted the country in the last 13 years. Much of the nation's roads are dirt, and due to rains and flooding, reaching the most impacted areas will be difficult.

     desc: Madagascar est l’un des pays considérés les plus pauvres au monde par la Banque Mondiale (plus de 9 personnes sur 10 vivent avec moins de 2€ par jour). Avec des cyclones qui déplacent en moyenne 200 000 personnes tous les ans, et un contexte politique très fragile, les conditions de vie se dégradent chaque année. Pompiers Humanitaire Français (PHF), a besoin d'une carte détaillée de la commune pour améliorer la gestion des opérations courantes (tel que le repérage et l’analyse des lieux d’intervention), mais aussi mieux gérer les situations de crise (anticipation des réactions en cas de catastrophes et coordination des secours).

     desc: The city of Antsiranana has no effective map showing points of interests and tourist circuits, but still Antsiranana and its region can prevail themselves of  grandiose landscapes and a very rich history. This mapping project will allow to make this cultural and natural heritage more visible for tourists, bringing the voice of their communities, and it will favor the economic development of the region. This remote mapping will be followed by the local community in several mapathons during the OSMGeoWeek. Once the necessary data are collected, the local community will be able to spread its touristic map of the city!

     desc: Cet projet s’intègre dans un projet pédagogique au sein de l’Institut d’études supérieures de Soavinandriana Itasy. Notre objectif est de réaliser un plan de toute la commune intégrant les routes, le bâti et l’hydrographie. Ces éléments serviront de base à des relevés de terrain sur les projets de développement ayant eu lieu sur le territoire communal. Dans le cadre de ces relevés, un focus spécifique sera réalisé sur l’eau et l’assainissement dans le but de fournir aux acteurs du développement des éléments de diagnostic.
