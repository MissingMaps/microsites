     desc: The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur. The objective of MSF's activities in this area is to help displaced people get vital healthcare and hygiene support, both through supporting the Ministry of Health and through targeted "MSF-independent" activities. As the needs are not uniform, the delivery of these medical services will need to be highly targeted. To map the needs of these vulnerable communities, and to facilitate targeted interventions, the MSF team need accurate base maps.
