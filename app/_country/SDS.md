    desc: MSF team have indicated a new priority area for data - 20 - 40 km radius from Aweil Town. Please prioritise mapping and validating in the red shaded area! Aweil, the capital of South Sudan’s Northern Bahr el Ghazal State, is home to tens of thousands of people, many of whom live on the city’s largely unmapped outskirts. Putting these settlements on the map is the first step to collecting crucial health and demographic data that will help MSF provide essential medical care to this underserved population. Mapping the Aweil region will allow MSF to conduct surveys to learn where patients live, where medical needs are most acute, and where seasonal peaks in illnesses like malaria and malnutrition are likely to occur.
