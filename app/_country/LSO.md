     desc: JOSM Validator should be run each time a tile is selected The goal is is accurate and complete data with as few errors as possible The basemap is completed for the #MapLesotho project. This task forms part of a collection of 11 new tasks (10 districts, 1 city) to move the mapping from a national to a local district level.  Completion of this task will result in 100% coverage for all roads, waterways and buildings with all features being accurately mapped to ensure a high level of quality. An important element of this task requires that JOSM validator is run each time a tile is selected to correct errors from previous mapping attempts.

     desc: Provide a limited focus area for hyper detailed mapping in locations that are urban, and growing fast in a Lesotho context, or have national infrastructure and development.  This will be mainly completed by on-the-ground surveys, utilising Mapillary images and local knowledge.  It is not expected that there will be much to map from imagery in this task however if you spot something that has been missed, go ahead an add it, but this should be rare (depending on the area).  Carry the mapping task forwards to further support the evidence basis for Physical Planning in Lesotho
