     desc: MSF needs to get a fair statistical representation sample of populations in a specific district of Malawi (Nsanje District).The maps will help MSF team on the field to find access more easily to randomly selected villages and group of houses. MSF is conducting an important study that aims to gather critical information about the real and true percentage of people affected by HIV. We need to know as precisely as possible, within that given population who has been tested for HIV, and who has started  treatment, are currently under treatment, and are responding well to it.  This study will help the MSF and Ministry of Health teams in the field better measure the current, joint effort to fight HIV. It will help steer the MSF and Ministry of Health decision making process and should lead to better and more impactful operations. The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.
