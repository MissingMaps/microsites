     desc: The Peace Corps public health program in Mozambique is requesting assistance building a base map in Namaacha. The program conducts annual bed-net distribution campaigns in the town for malaria prevention. Volunteers will use the base map as part of monitoring and evaluation activities, particularly to conduct geo-spatial analysis of malaria related behavior change over time and space.

     desc: The Peace Corps public health and education program in Mozambique is requesting assistance to inventory roads and buildings for a more detailed basemap of Mecanhelas. The map data will be used by a variety of stakeholders, including the local school to paint localized map murals and health organizations to better identify and navigate to patients and their families. Local groups will also use the map data for a geocoded malaria net survey while planning for an upcoming bednet distribution.

     desc: The Peace Corps Education program in Mozambique is requesting assistance creating a basemap of Mocuba. The map will be used as the base for Field Paper activities within a youth map literacy and mapmaking program. The map will also be used by community members to identify geographic areas of interest for community development and aid efforts. More detailed basemap data (roads, villages, streets) is needed to assist the program.

Peace Corps Mozambique is requesting assistance in creating a basemap of all towns and cities within the district of Vilankulo, Inhambane Province. The finished maps will be used primarily as foundations for mapping mosquito net coverage within each town. Surveys regarding net coverage will be facilitated by local health workers through CommCare's smart phone-driven, paperless survey application. Follow-up distributions of bed nets will use the subsequent survey data and OSM basemap to inform their campaigns.
