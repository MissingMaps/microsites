    desc: Médecins Sans Frontières is preparing several programme interventions in the city of Nsanje in Malawi, in particular against HIV and tuberculosis. Mapping the road network and residential area will be useful for MSF's team to plan their intervention. This task is appropriate for new mappers

    desc: MSF is running a local project to improve HIV medication in remote rural areas in Mozambique. MSF will need an accurate map of the road network and settlements to reach their patients, and particularly the Community Antiretroviral therapy Groups (GAC). These groups gather patients that are travelling - sometimes for long - to receive their medication. It is therefore crucial to identifiy precisely where they are, and what is the easiest way to get to them. There is no freely available mapping data available for the province, aside from that which has been already generously contributed by the OSM community until now. MSF counts on you to facilitate their deployment in the district! The data will also benefit other programmes in this vulnerable area.

    desc: Médecins Sans Frontières is opening a new operation in the Tete province of Mozambique to fight a cholera outbreak. MSF's team will need a better map of the settlements and roads in the area in order to find their way in this remote province and reach the vulnerable populations that live there. Several GIS specialists have been deployed in the MSF operation since November to produce maps. The data contributed in OpenStreetMap is and will be crucial for him to create quality maps that will benefit all MSF's teams, and prepare long-term geographic products that will benefit humanitarian interventions in the area in the long term.

    desc: MSF needs to get a fair statistical representation sample of populations in a specific district of Malawi (Nsanje District).The maps will help MSF team on the field to find access more easily to randomly selected villages and group of houses. MSF is conducting an important study that aims to gather critical information about the real and true percentage of people affected by HIV. We need to know as precisely as possible, within that given population who has been tested for HIV, and who has started  treatment, are currently under treatment, and are responding well to it.  This study will help the MSF and Ministry of Health teams in the field better measure the current, joint effort to fight HIV. It will help steer the MSF and Ministry of Health decision making process and should lead to better and more impactful operations.
