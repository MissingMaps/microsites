     desc: <p>The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.</p> MSF is currently assessing populations that have been displaced from their homes and livelihoods due to the devastating civil conflict that erupted in December 2013. MSF is planning to fly in medical teams by helicopter to assess displaced populations in Akobo for illnesses and malnutrition, with a view to setting up a medical intervention. In order to do this they need to know beforehand where the populations are and how to access them by foot. This mapping initiative is crucial to helping our teams plan their movements and ensure we reach as many people as possible in the small amount of time we have on the ground.
