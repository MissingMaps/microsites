     desc: The MENTOR Initiative as part of an Elimination 8 consortium is working to build a footprint map in Southern Angola to aid upcoming malaria field work later in 2017. This work is part of a final push undertaken in partnership with the National malaria control programmes in Namibia and southern Angola to end malaria. Your contribution is critical. By mapping buildings, roads, homes, water bodies and key landmarks, you will help to improve operational efficiencies for this malaria program, allowing for better targeting of limited resources, and accelerating progress on the path to malaria elimination. MENTOR, in conjunction with its partners, works towards reducing deaths and suffering from tropical diseases in many locations around the world.
