     desc: The Southern parts of Malawi along the Lower Shire river (that connects Lake Malawi and Zambezi River) are frequently flooded and affects the villages of farmers around. The national Department of Disaster Management Affairs in Malawi - DoDMA and GFDRR agreed about the necessity to have detailed data of the region, through a community mapping in the field, that could be used to build hazard impact scenarios with tools like InaSafe in order to improve the planning, preparedness and response activities  HOT funded Project. This job aims at allowing a GISCorps team to complete and clean the mapping already done in the field.

     desc: The Peace Corps public health program in Malawi is requesting assistance building a better base map of Maganga. Peace Corps Volunteers and local health professionals will use the map data to plan and implement malaria prevention interventions and other targeted community health projects.

     desc: Karonga is a small town in Northern Malawi. The population is less than 50,000 but growing at a rate of around 2.5% per year, which could result in a doubling of population over the next 30 - 40 years. Karonga suffers from a range of hazards which include. earthquakes, floods, strong winds, food insecurity, pests, disease, lightning, hail and fires, which have resulted in fatalities, health and economic impacts over the past decades. Under scenarios of high population growth, urbanisation and climate variability, it is quite possible that residents could experience greater impacts from hazards in Karonga in the coming years.  To better understand what structures might be impacted by hazards such as earthquakes and floods, and how people and goods move about during a disaster, there is a clear need to improve our understanding of the built infrastructure in Karonga. This data will be used by teams in the UK and Malawi to better understand scenarios of hazard impacts upon the infrastructure of Karonga, under the DfID-ESRC funded Urban Africa Risk Knowledge Project (Urban ARK). We hope this improved basemap of Karonga will also help the many other NGOs and community projects that work in the area on topics such as development, sanitation and health.

     desc: The Peace Corps program in Malawi is requesting assistance in building a base map of Chikwina to be used by secondary students and clinic staff alike. The aim of this map is to introduce young people &amp; community members to Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D), while also supporting their local health systems. This base map will be the foundation for future GIS programs and other technologic first for Chikwina, such as mobile survey applications.

     desc: The American Red Cross is a member of the Measles &amp; Rubella Initiative, which seeks to eliminate these diseases. We will be conducting a measles campaign in Malawi in spring 2017. This task will create a basemap of the area in order to help Red Cross teams to plan logistics and prepare for mobile data collection and field mapping in the areas. We will initially focus on these areas of Lilongwe. This task is also part of the Missing Maps project, which aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises).

     desc: MSF needs to get a fair statistical representation sample of populations in a specific district of Malawi (Nsanje District).The maps will help MSF team on the field to find access more easily to randomly selected villages and group of houses. MSF is conducting an important study that aims to gather critical information about the real and true percentage of people affected by HIV. We need to know as precisely as possible, within that given population who has been tested for HIV, and who has started  treatment, are currently under treatment, and are responding well to it.  This study will help the MSF and Ministry of Health teams in the field better measure the current, joint effort to fight HIV. It will help steer the MSF and Ministry of Health decision making process and should lead to better and more impactful operations.
