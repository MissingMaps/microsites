      Médecins Sans Frontières is running a local project in Kapise Camp, East
      of Tete Province to improve the provision of aid to local people affected
      by the conflict between RENAMO (the opposition) and FRELIMO (the main
      party in Mozambique).

      The American Red Cross is a member of the Measles &amp; Rubella
      Initiative, which seeks to eliminate these diseases. We will be conducting
      a measles campaign in Malawi in spring 2017. This task will create a
      basemap of the area in order to help Red Cross teams to plan logistics and
      prepare for mobile data collection and field mapping in the areas. We will
      initially focus on these areas of Lilongwe. This task is also part of the
      Missing Maps project, which aims to map the most vulnerable places in the
      world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict,
      natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's
      disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate
      pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster
      response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.
      Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of
      the U.S. Department of State is providing the OpenStreetMap community
      access to updated satellite imagery services to help assist with
      humanitarian mapping.

      MSF needs to get a fair statistical representation sample of populations
      in a specific district of Malawi (Nsanje District).The maps will help MSF
      team on the field to find access more easily to randomly selected villages
      and group of houses. MSF is conducting an important study that aims to
      gather critical information about the real and true percentage of people
      affected by HIV. We need to know as precisely as possible, within that
      given population who has been tested for HIV, and who has started
      treatment, are currently under treatment, and are responding well to it.
      This study will help the MSF and Ministry of Health teams in the field
      better measure the current, joint effort to fight HIV. It will help steer
      the MSF and Ministry of Health decision making process and should lead to
      better and more impactful operations.
