   - desc: The American Red Cross is a member of the Measles &amp; Rubella Initiative, which seeks to eliminate these diseases. We will be conducting a measles campaign in Malawi in spring 2017. This task will create a basemap of the area in order to help Red Cross teams to plan logistics and prepare for mobile data collection and field mapping in the areas. We will initially focus on these areas of Lilongwe. This task is also part of the Missing Maps project, which aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT&#39;s disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur. Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of the U.S. Department of State is providing the OpenStreetMap community access to updated satellite imagery services to help assist with humanitarian mapping.

   - desc: MSF needs to get a fair statistical representation sample of populations in a specific district of Malawi (Nsanje District).The maps will help MSF team on the field to find access more easily to randomly selected villages and group of houses. MSF is conducting an important study that aims to gather critical information about the real and true percentage of people affected by HIV. We need to know as precisely as possible, within that given population who has been tested for HIV, and who has started  treatment, are currently under treatment, and are responding well to it.  This study will help the MSF and Ministry of Health teams in the field better measure the current, joint effort to fight HIV. It will help steer the MSF and Ministry of Health decision making process and should lead to better and more impactful operations.
