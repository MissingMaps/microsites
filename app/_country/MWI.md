    desc: The Salima District is a relatively small district in Malawi which is often affected by flooding. Today, UNICEF Malawi and our partners lack a fit-for-purpose digital road network to support service delivery to most vulnerable woman and children. A connected and topologically correct road network dataset will, for example, help us better target programmes to increase accessibility to health services and be more efficient at delivering of nutrition services to malnourished children under two years old in remote areas. If successful, we hope to replicate this mapathon initiative to cover additional districts of Malawi in the coming months.
