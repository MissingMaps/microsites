     desc: Peace Corps' Public Health program in Botswana is requesting assistance to inventory buildings and roads for HIV/AIDS and TB prevention and treatment programs. Mochudi is a large village in Botswana. Like many areas of Botswana Mochudi suffers from high rates of HIV/AIDS prevalence as well as disproportionately high rates of TB. It is difficult to reach all of Mochudi's population, which is nearly 45,000 with HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention programs. With the help of OpenStreetMap, the District AIDS Office along with the District Health Management Team, plans to map the entirety of Mochudi, and later all of Kgatleng District. Upon completion of the map these organizations will be able to better analyze areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS. The District Health Management Team also plans to use OSM and geospatial data to improve operations of its TB, HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection clinics.
