    desc: The National Malaria Programme in Botswana and the Clinton Health Access Initiative are working with the Missing Maps team to comprehensively build a footprint map to aid upcoming malaria control and elimination field work in 2016, as part of a final push at the total elimination of malaria. Botswana is well-positioned to be one of the first countries in southern Africa to eliminate malaria in the next few years. In 2015, Botswana reported 276 cases of malaria countrywide, a number that reduced from a staggering 8,056 in 2000 thanks to the scale-up of effective interventions and surveillance in the communities.
