    desc: The National Malaria Programme in Botswana and the Clinton Health Access Initiative are working with the Missing Maps team to comprehensively build a footprint map to aid upcoming malaria control and elimination field work in 2016, as part of a final push at the total elimination of malaria. Botswana is well-positioned to be one of the first countries in southern Africa to eliminate malaria in the next few years. In 2015, Botswana reported 276 cases of malaria countrywide, a number that reduced from a staggering 8,056 in 2000 thanks to the scale-up of effective interventions and surveillance in the communities.

Your contribution is critical. By mapping buildings, roads, homes, water bodies and key landmarks, you will help to improve operational efficiencies for the malaria control program, allowing for better targeting of limited resources, and accelerating Botswana’s progress on the path to malaria elimination by 2018. The resultant resource and cost savings will allow the government to invest in other public health areas, such as health education and awareness, improved housing and high quality disease surveillance.

    desc: Update/Validation Project This project is to review, update and complete the basemap (buildings and roads) in this region of Botswana. Some of the region has been mapped before but much of it was several years ago. Your mapping contribution will help prevent the suffering and loss of life the disease malaria causes.
