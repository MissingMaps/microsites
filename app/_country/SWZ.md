     desc: New Swaziland Malaria Elimination Project 1393 The southern African Kingdom of Swaziland is leading the way in the global fight against malaria and is on the verge of making history by eliminating malaria from its borders by the end of 2016 according to the Kingdom of Swaziland National Malaria Control Programme. If the country achieves malaria elimination, it will be the first country in southern Africa to achieve zero local cases. Please be a part of this amazing effort at eliminating malaria in Swaziland in 2016 and map in some buildings! Buildings only - very easy mapping - great for new mappers <p>The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.</p>
