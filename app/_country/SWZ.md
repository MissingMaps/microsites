    desc: Still needs validation! The southern African Kingdom of Swaziland is leading the way in the global fight against malaria and is on the verge of making history by eliminating malaria from its borders by the end of 2016 according to the Kingdom of Swaziland National Malaria Control Programme. If the country achieves malaria elimination, it will be the first country in southern Africa to achieve zero local cases. Please be a part of this amazing effort at eliminating malaria in Swaziland in 2016 and map in some buildings! Great for new mappers - Buildings only - Very easy but important mapping
