     desc: Every year in the Americas more and more people are living in conditions of vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. To help reduce disaster risk and enhance community resilience in the region, the American Red Cross is working with Red Cross partners in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean to address local hazards and vulnerabilities in dozens of disaster-prone communities.  This initiative began with a Red Cross-led assessment process in which communities themselves identified the most significant risks they face and the actions they can take to mitigate them. Some examples of community interventions include strengthening water and sanitation systems, delivering key messages about health promotion and disease prevention, and training and equipping community members with first aid skills and supplies. In addition to addressing specific hazards, another key program component is working with communities so they are able to self-organize and self-manage advocacy or education efforts that will help them be better prepared for future disasters. The American Red Cross is also helping strengthen the capacity of Red Cross partners in the region to deliver services to communities. There is currently very little data for the area and there is a strong need for a more detailed basemap data (buildings, roads, land features, rivers) to assist with program operations and decision making.

     desc: Every year in the Americas more and more people are living in conditions of vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. To help reduce disaster risk and enhance community resilience in the region, the American Red Cross is working with Red Cross partners in the Bahamas, Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama and Peru to address local hazards and vulnerabilities in dozens of disaster-prone communities.  The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur. Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of the U.S. Department of State is providing the OpenStreetMap community access to updated satellite imagery services to help assist with humanitarian mapping.

     desc: The Forecast-based Financing (FbF) project in Peru, by the Red Cross Climate Centre, intends to support the vulnerable people of the Amazonas flood plain exposed to severe floods. Given the high risk of water vector-borne diseases and damage to houses, the Peruvian Red Cross with the support of the German Red Cross are developing a FbF mechanism, based on forecast information, to support families in a timely manner to conduct mitigation and preparedness actions to minimize these risks due to their vulnerability and exposure to floods. Exposure data is still a challenge, as existing maps do not show clearly where households are located, therefore having a map of the existing communities, will help us to analyse the extend of potential affectation based on historical data and it will allow us to prioritize in a more effective way the most exposed and vulnerable households.
