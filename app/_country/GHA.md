   - id: 1100
     desc: The objective is to introduce people to OpenStreetMap in Ghana and map flood affected areas in the 2015 #AccraFloods which led to death of hundreds of people due to filling station explosion.
   - id: 1260
     desc: This project is made to map the neighbourhood of Madina in Accra, Ghana, down to the building level.
   - id: 3296
     desc: Ghana has 40 College of Education, under the National Council for Tertiary Education. This tasks supports the Council in improving the infrastructure at the Colleges. This task is particularly suitable for mappers using JOSM.
   - id: 3322
     desc: This project is to trace buildings in Teshie Nungua as part of OpenStreetMap session during Africa Open Data Conference in Accra, Ghana. This project is easy for beginning mappers using the iD editor and also JOSM. The aim of this task is to demonstrate the importance of Open Geo Data, how community engagement and Open Data can bring about innovation and development.
   - id: 3839
     desc: The George Washington University, with support from with GFDRR, the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, and other partners,  have created a system that combines machine learning and Forecast-based Financing to effectively integrate information, decisions, and consequences. When upstream rainfall and reservoir levels indicate that inundation downstream is likely, a message is automatically transmitted to the local Red Cross, who can release funds from the Forecast-based Financing system to activate preparedness measures before the flood hits.

     desc: Mapping buildings. This project afford students of the UMaT Youthmappers chapter the opportunity to scale up their mapping skills. This will be followed up with a field exercise to validate the features and added attribute data. Imagery. Bing NB. If you're using JOSM, don't forget to use Building tools plugin.
