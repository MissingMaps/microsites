     desc: Project description This task is to map one of the areas in which The Nepal Red Cross supported by the American Red Cross is implementing earthquake recovery programs. The improved basemap will be used to better inform those programs. Additionally, community mobilizers and volunteers will be trained to collect additional data about their area. Missing Maps The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur. MapGive Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of the U.S. Department of State is providing the OpenStreetMap community access to updated satellite imagery services to help assist with humanitarian mapping.

     desc: In an effort to expand the Missing Maps community, WFP and MapAction along with ICIMOD, Kathmandu Living Labs and the Nepal GIS Society are holding a Mapathon to support the disaster preparedness work of the WFP in Nepal. The task will focus on building the skills of new mappers in an area known to them to get a taste for what the Missing Maps is about and the confidence to map another day.

     desc: The British Red Cross is mapping Dhangadhi sub-metropolitan city in Far-Western Nepal as part of the Strengthening Urban Resilience and Engagement (“SURE”) programme. The SURE programme builds on a programme implemented by the Nepal Red Cross (NRCS) from 2012 to 2015 to help the Kathmandu valley prepare for an earthquake, expanding to work in seven municipalities across three of Nepal’s major urban centres. A mobile phone-based survey is about to be undertaken including in Dhangadhi. Data will be used to measure change throughout and at the end of the programme. In addition, as part of urban assessments, this data will be used to create hazard maps with citizens and vulnerable communities.
