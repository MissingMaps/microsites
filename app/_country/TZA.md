     desc: The American Red Cross and Tanzanian Red Cross are beginning long term disaster risk reduction programming in rural Tanzania. The Red Cross hopes to capture GIS data using OSM and needs more detailed basemap data (roads, land features, rivers) to assist in the project design phase. The maps produced will be used to create more efficient and grounded programs to reduce the risk or disease and environmental disaster from affecting the communities. The purpose of this task is to trace roads, rivers, land features, all buildings, and other landmarks.

     desc: On 25 April, the President of Burundi announced that he would run for a third term in scheduled elections. This contravened the constitution and triggered widespread protest which has since. As a result, there is now a refugee crisis in Tanzania. Since the unrest began, 76,500 Burundi refugees having arrived in Tanzania (as of 19 May 2015) and cases of cholera have now also been confirmed in the refugee population. These people are highly vulnerable with currently no access to shelter, clean water or health services.  The main destination for incoming refugees is Nyarugusu Refugee Camp. As such, we need this area mapped so that assistance can be provided to arrivals in the most efficient and effective way.

     desc: The Kigoma Region is the region between Burundi and Tanzania where Burundian refugees cross the border. A cholera outbreak is now spreading in this area, especially in the town of Kigoma and the refugee camp of Nyagurusu. NGOs on the ground need better road and residential area data to respond, especially on the Tanzanian side which is much less mapped than Burundi. <p>The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.</p>

     desc: The Dar es Salaam has experienced a rash of deadly flash floods in recent months, and the map data generated by this event will be used to develop an early warning system to alert residents of future flooding. Digital Globe is supporting the effort to map 3 wards (Keko, Sendali, and Mbagala) in Dar es Salaam as part of a long term consortium Disaster Risk Reduction program with the World Bank, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), Ardhi Univeristy, Tanzania Red Cross Society, Danish Red Cross, Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, University of Dar es Salaam, and Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH). The purpose of this task is to trace all buildings. HOT is training and leading teams from Ramani Huria and OSM Tanzania that will work in the coming weeks to ground truth the data. <p>The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises).
