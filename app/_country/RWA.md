    desc: The American Red Cross, with support from MapGive  is beginning long term disaster risk reduction programming in Nyaruguru, Rwanda. The Red Cross hopes to capture GIS data using OSM and needs more detailed basemap data (roads, land features, rivers) to assist in the project design phase. The maps produced will be used to create more efficient and grounded programs to reduce the risk or disease and environmental disaster from affecting the communities in Nyaruguru, Rwanda. The purpose of this task is to trace roads, rivers, land features, major buildings, and other landmarks.
