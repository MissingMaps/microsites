     desc: Mpazi River Catchment has been identified as the main source of rainfall runoff water causing flash floods in Nyabugogo Commercial Center located in the downstream area of the catchment. The local OpenStreetMap community would like to map the catchment area to help local authorities better plan for disaster risk management by promoting better spatial land-use planning and relocating people living in high risk zones.
