     desc: The British Red Cross is mapping the Kurigram District in Bangladesh as part of a Vulnerability to Resilence (V2R) project. The V2R project was designed to replicate and build on a successful resilience program implemented by Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDCRS) to implement disaster risk reduction activities to enhance resilience to future floods. A midline survey is about to be conducted across 30 communities. Data will be used to measure change throughout, and at the end of, the project.
