     desc: Due to political conflicts, violences have hit South Sudan since mid-December 2013 and may become a civil war. Minkamman is one small town in Awerial county, Lakes State, South Sudan, where tens of thousands of IDPs fleeing from Bor are being looked after mid January.  This job aims at mapping Minkamman with Bing Imagery to get the pre-crisis context, before maybe having access to post-disaster imagery. Minkamman est une petite ville du comté d'Awerial, dans l'Etat des Lacs au Sud Soudan, où des dizaines de millers de Personnes Déplacées Internes fuyant Bor sont attendues mi-janvier. Cette tâche vise à cartographier Minkamman avec l'imagerie Bing pour avoir un état de la situation avant crise, avant peut-être d'avoir accès à de l'imagerie post-crise

     desc: Following the Sentinel analysis report, Mayom was severely burned. The OSM data will be useful as a baseline dataset in order to monitor the damages and plan the reconstruction.  Cette tâche vise à cartographier le bourg de Mayom avec l'imagerie Bing pour avoir un état de la situation avant crise. D'après le rapport d'analyse Sentinel, Mayom a été sévèrement brûlée. La donnée OSM sera utile en tant que donnée de base pour l'analyse des dommages et la planification de la reconstruction.

     desc: Validation needed! Aweil, the capital of South Sudan’s Northern Bahr el Ghazal State, is home to tens of thousands of people, many of whom live on the city’s largely unmapped outskirts. Putting these settlements on the map is the first step to collecting crucial health and demographic data that will help MSF provide essential medical care to this underserved population. Mapping the Aweil region will allow MSF to conduct surveys to learn where patients live, where medical needs are most acute, and where seasonal peaks in illnesses like malaria and malnutrition are likely to occur.
