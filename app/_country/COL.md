    desc: The American Red Cross has been running the Resilience In The Americas Program (RITA) with the Colombian Red Cross (ERC) to build resilient communities. The Red Cross GIS team will traveling to La Guajira to train local staff and volunteers how to capture GIS data using the OpenStreetMap platform. There is currently very little data for the area and there is a strong need for a more detailed basemap data (buildings, roads, land features, rivers) to assist with program operations and decision making.
