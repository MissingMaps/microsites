    desc: The American Red Cross has been running the Resilience In The Americas Program (RITA) with the Ecuadorian Red Cross (ERC) to build resilient communities. So far in Ecuador the program has supported 15 communities, located in “El Oro” Province, Canton of Huaquillas by strengthening its organizational process, training to communitarian members and key actors, improving the physical environment and doing advocacy with stakeholders, including the local government and other instances with communitarian incidence. Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of the U.S. Department of State is providing the OpenStreetMap community access to updated satellite imagery services to help assist with humanitarian mapping.
