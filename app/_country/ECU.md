     desc: In August 2015, Ecuador declared a state of emergency after Cotopaxi shot ash 7 miles into the air on August 2015. The volcano has since continued spewing ash and steam, causing continued concern for those living in the vulnerable areas nearby. Currently, not much open data exists for the region, which is concerning since many high populated areas are located nearby – including the nation’s capital, Quito. Due to the former, roads, buildings, rivers, and bridges are the primary needs for feature tracing within OpenStreetMap.
