     desc: Mapping the regional capital of Kedougou, Senegal for use by the health system in planning malaria prevention interventions.
   - id: 3977
     desc: The Kedougou region is the southeastern most region of Senegal. Only in 2008 was it declared its own region. There are currently many government- and community- initiated efforts in this region focusing on health, agriculture, and community economic development. Mapping has been introduced to the region as a useful tool in advancing such efforts. The Kedougou Health Ministry hopes to use an improved map of the region to work with health facilities to track NGO presence as well as create visuals of trends/hot spots relating to disease burden, including malaria and malnutrition. Farmers are interested in using maps to track cashew farms and trainings. Maps can also help expand waste management businesses by determining the best routes for waste collection. Additionally, Kedougou is home to many beautiful waterfalls, attracting tourists all throughout the year. Eco-tourism businesses, such as hotels or tour guides, can benefit from a map of the communities they work in. While these are only a few of the many ways in which mapping can enhance current projects in the Kedougou region, the very first step is to have a base map.
