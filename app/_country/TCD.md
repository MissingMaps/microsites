     desc: The Hadjer Lamis area of Chad is very poor, and there is an unusual burden of disease and malnutrition amongst the people who live there, which contributes to high mortality in children under five years old. In order to better understand, assess, and respond to this, we need to know more about the population. MSF teams are mapping villages and taking their names on the ground, but identifying all of the inhabited areas and counting the structures is much more efficient from aerial photos. Knowing where all of the villages are scattered through the savanna helps us to map them, and counting the buildings within each village gives us a quick and fairly accurate method to estimate population. This is important to help MSF understand the spread of disease and identify areas of highest need.  The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.

     desc: Cartographie de Faya-Largeau le chef-lieu du département de Borkou.  Ce projet est créé en partenariat avec les Subsistances à Lyon. Ce projet a pour but d’ajouter les zones résidentielles, bâtiments, routes et lieux économiques pour une mission de déminage dans le nord du Tchad par Handicap International.  Plus particulièrement on cartographie dans la région de la ville de Faya-Largeau le chef-lieu du département de Borkou. Cette région est infesté de mine par une suite de conflit interne et de conflit avec la Libye (1979-1987) et aujourd’hui par le terrorisme (Boko Haram). Les routes, les terres agricoles, les points d’eau sont contaminées par des mines ou des restes d’explosifs de guerre. Toutes les zones infectées nuisent au développement économique de la région.  Le projet initié par Handicap International se déroulera sur 4 ans sur tout le nord du Tchad pour réduire les risques liés aux mines et autres engins explosifs. Outre le projet de déminage, Handicap International, entreprend de mettre en place un volet social, qui vise à garantir aux personnes les plus vulnérables (personne en situation de handicap) un accès aux soins par des mécanismes de protections sociales. Enfin, le projet a aussi une visée économique ; des projets collectifs seront financés, par exemple l’irrigation d’une palmeraie, après qu’elle sera déminée afin de lancer la culture de dattes.
