    desc: The Hadjer Lamis area of Chad is very poor, and there is an unusual burden of disease and malnutrition amongst the people who live there, which contributes to high mortality in children under five years old. In order to better understand, assess, and respond to this, we need to know more about the population. MSF teams are mapping villages and taking their names on the ground, but identifying all of the inhabited areas and counting the structures is much more efficient from aerial photos. Knowing where all of the villages are scattered through the savanna helps us to map them, and counting the buildings within each village gives us a quick and fairly accurate method to estimate population. This is important to help MSF understand the spread of disease and identify areas of highest need.
