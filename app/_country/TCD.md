   - desc: MSF&#39;s principal medical activity in the district of Moissala in southern Chad is to provide preventative and curative care for malarial infection for pregnant women and children under 5. In 2015 MSF is planning a pilot activity of indoor residual spraying (IRS) in the eastern zone of Moissala to further increase the prevention of Malaria for families who are isolated on the other side of the Bahr-Sara River, far from the referral hospital.  The logistics team in Moissala is working hard on a detailed map of the 133 villages in the zone in order to plan for the month-long spraying campaign with the help of local volunteers. Mapping the area will greatly help the team effectively plan their movements between villages and ensure they are able to reach all households and further decrease the transmission of this deadly disease for the population.

   - desc: The Hadjer Lamis area of Chad is very poor, and there is an unusual burden of disease and malnutrition amongst the people who live there, which contributes to high mortality in children under five years old. In order to better understand, assess, and respond to this, we need to know more about the population. MSF teams are mapping villages and taking their names on the ground, but identifying all of the inhabited areas and counting the structures is much more efficient from aerial photos. Knowing where all of the villages are scattered through the savanna helps us to map them, and counting the buildings within each village gives us a quick and fairly accurate method to estimate population. This is important to help MSF understand the spread of disease and identify areas of highest need.

   - desc: The Salamat region sees high levels of malaria. Outreach activities, run by MSF, out of Am Timan Hospital ensure that people in remote areas can get the medical care they need. Also, even in normal years, Chad has one of the highest rates of chronic malnutrition in the world. In early 2012, in some areas of the country, rates of global acute malnutrition as high as 24 percent were reported among children under the age of five.
