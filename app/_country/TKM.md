     desc: Urban renewal of the city of Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, involves spending $14.3 billion on expansion and upgrades of the street network; on construction of hundreds of new, modern buildings; and on development of modern infrastructure.  Ashgabat is located in a Category 4 seismic zone, which makes updating the city map on ongoing imperative.  In the event of a catastrophic earthquake, accurate and up-to-date maps will be crucial to rescue efforts.  In addition, mapping of new streets and buildings will allow local mappers to add data (house numbers, names) more easily. This mapping project is reserved for local mappers only.
