     desc: The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur. Kamrangirchar is the biggest slum in Dhaka, located in a peninsula area of 3.68 km² with an estimated 400,000 inhabitants. The area is bordered by the Buriganga river. Every day the Buriganga receives large volumes of untreated effluent coming from the tanneries localized in the neighbouring area of Hazaribagh. In the Kamrangirchar slum, many workers are believed to be exposed to poor working conditions in an environment of harmful chemical pollution.  Hazaribagh also appears heavily contaminated and highly polluted, with poor working conditions comparable to Kamrangirchar. The environmental landscape appears heavily contaminated by waste. Both areas are almost completely unmapped and Missing Maps seeks to create base maps to enable local government, health services, individuals and NGOs operating in the area the means by which to better allocate resources and plan services. This mapping activity is not intended for political use or to put people working in local industry out of work. It is simply putting a vulnerable population on the map, so that they can receive necessary services. This task will be followed in late January by local mapping activities.

     desc: On the ground in Dhaka blog post. The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate preemptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur. The American Red Cross will be working with the Bangladesh Red Crescent in mid-May to map several areas in Dhaka for a long term disaster risk reduction project. The data created during the remote mapping will be ground truthed using Field Papers and OpenMapKit, a digital mapping application developed by the American Red Cross and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team.

     desc: We are mapping Kaligram to assist Y Care International and the local YMCA to conduct work around disaster risk reduction (DRR) and health. Data on health facilities and schools will be collected by ICS volunteers during their 10-week placement.

     desc: We are mapping the Durgapur area of Netrokona district to assist Y Care International and the local YMCA to conduct work around disaster risk reduction (DRR) and health. Data on health facilities and schools will be collected during a field visit at the end of June. Flooding is also a problem in this area and a priority will be bodies of water. This task has been created to map the buildings in the area.

     desc:   This is a task for advanced mappers    It requires mapping in a dense urban area with large variation in building height and size. Mappers on this task should be comfortable (1) using JOSM, (2) switching between two different satellite imagery sources, and (3) tracing tall buildings using off-nadir imagery.  The American Red Cross is working with the Bangladesh Red Crescent to map several areas in Dhaka for a long term disaster risk reduction project.  Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of the U.S. Department of State is providing the OpenStreetMap community access to updated satellite imagery services to help assist with humanitarian mapping.
