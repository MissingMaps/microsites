     desc: Stanford University Pediatric Global Health Physician/Scientist Eric Nelson is undertaking a study in Kendua, Bangladesh, to leverage mobile technology in overcoming fundamental clinical challenges in treating childhood diarrheal disease (primarily, Cholera) in resource-poor settings. The app being developed will capture geographic information about the generalized home location of patients admitted for diarrheal disease in order to identify outbreak clusters early, improve care, and advance our basic understanding of the disease. The app will require a base map, and OSM needs improvement in Kendua. The technology we are building and testing will have application to other outbreaks situations, like Ebola.

     desc: Validation needed! Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics(BBS) is the only national Statistical institution responsible for collecting, compiling and disseminating statistical data of all the sectors of the Bangladesh economy to meet and provide the data-needs of the users and stakeholders, like national level planners and other agencies of the Govt. Under the auspices of the computer wing of BBS, a development project entitled "Strengthening Capacity of BBS in Population and Demographic Data Collection Using GIS" is being implemented. The objective is to prepare digital enumeration area maps for conducting various censuses and surveys, aiming to reduce non-sampling errors. In this regard the self-supported easy and low cost geo data gathering tool “OpenStreetMap” can be a good option for collecting GIS data at field level. Under the business area of Supporting Poor Inclusive Sector Reform, WSP, World Bank Bangladesh, along with other WSP offices, has successfully organized two Hackathon with community of sanitation and water and ICT experts in order to identify and develop ICT solutions to water and sanitation-related challenges confronting developing country Bangladesh.  WSP provides technical assistance, facilitates knowledge exchange, and promotes evidence-based advancements in sector dialogue. WSP team warmly delivered the OpenStreetMap knowledge to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics for their Demographic Data Collection Using GIS project. Now, WSP Bangladesh and BBS want to do a piloting for Household level data collection along with other features in two unions of Singair upazila of Manikganj District. If it is successful for BBS's easy data base creation then it will be replicated all over Bangladesh. The field validation will be done after completing the remote mapping with this task.

     desc: waiting for imagery to open for validation Monsoon season in South Asia has brought above average rainfall, resulting in devastating flooding across the region in Bangladesh, Nepal, and India. Over 1,200 people have died as a result, and over 30 million people have been impacted. Mapping projects in the most affected districts of Bangladesh will provide an updated road map and dataset for the the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society and the IFRC.

     desc: The British Red Cross is mapping the Kurigram District in Bangladesh as part of a Vulnerability to Resilence (V2R) project. The V2R project was designed to replicate and build on a successful resilience program implemented by Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDCRS) to implement disaster risk reduction activities to enhance resilience to future floods. A midline survey is about to be conducted across 30 communities. Data will be used to measure change throughout, and at the end of, the project.
