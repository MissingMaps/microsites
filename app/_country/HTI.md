    desc: The American Red Cross is supporting the Haitian Red Cross to expand their community based disaster response and health efforts into new communities in the northern metropolitan Port au Prince area. The communities outlined are at significant exposure to seasonal and acute flooding risks and they lack access to basic health services, disaster preparedness plans and disaster response plans. Haitian Red Cross plans to expand their local volunteer network into these communities in 2015; they will train community members in first aid, emergency response and evacuation, as well as link them to healthcare services. Updated maps will support Haitian Red Cross to identify safe emergency shelter sites as well as to prepare emergency evacuations routes that reflect population centers and road network capacity. Furthermore, updated maps will help Haitian Red Cross to identify particularly vulnerable families and plan ways to improve access to them.

Tracing will allow the Red Cross to better understand settlement patterns and do a household count in support of a community capacity assessment.  Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of the U.S. Department of State is providing the OpenStreetMap community access to updated satellite imagery services to help assist with humanitarian mapping.

    desc: Hispaniola, which includes Haiti and the Dominican Republic, is the only island in the Caribbean where malaria is still endemic. Malaria Zero is an alliance of partners who have united to eliminate malaria from Hispaniola by 2020, creating a malaria-free zone across the Caribbean in just a few years’ time. In 2014, there were approximately 17,000 conﬁrmed cases of malaria in Haiti and only 500 in the Dominican Republic. The disease has an especially negative impact on Haiti’s already fragile economy, exacerbating poverty and decreasing productivity. Malaria Zero is assisting to improve surveillance to track all cases; deliver services at the community level; test, diagnose, and treat all cases; and treat high-risk populations and prevent onward transmission. Eliminating malaria on Hispaniola will create a malaria-free zone across the Caribbean, strengthen Haiti’s health system, and bring the world one step closer to global malaria eradication.

Eliminating malaria on Hispaniola will create a malaria-free zone across the Caribbean, strengthen Haiti’s health system, and bring the world one step closer to global malaria eradication. The Malaria Zero partnership is focusing initial efforts on a few of the areas of Haiti with the highest malaria risk, including Anse-d’Hainault commune. Accurate maps of where the 20,000 residents of this commune live will enable the government and its partners to census the population, understand where transmission is occurring, and devise targeted strategies for eliminating malaria from this region. By tracing buildings, roads, and waterways, you’ll make a critical contribution to eliminating this terrible – yet preventable and treatable – disease from Haiti once and for all!

    desc: The American Red Cross and Haitian Red Cross need help tracing the roads, building footprints, and landuses in Caracol, Nord-Est, Haiti. We'll use this data to jump-start on-the-ground mapping by Haitian Red Cross staff and volunteers. Getting a basic "skeleton" of data down will allow us to focus our mapping efforts on improving the existing data and producing detailed maps of individual communities.

    desc: Part of Concern/Esri Ireland mapathon, please only map as part of that event Concern Worldwide is working with communities in Port au Prince to make sustainable improvements in poverty levels and mitigate against risks of conflict and disasters. While some areas of Cite Soleil have been mapped a number of areas are still missing basic information such as buildings and roads, which makes planning and implementing projects more difficult. This collaborative project aims to enhance and provide more useful details to the maps available for Concern Worldwide and partners to reach areas most in need of assistance and to produce open source visualisations of the urban and rural environments that communities live and work in. The Aerial imagery is provided by Cosmha, Cartong and OSM France as part of the UAV mission done in May 2014.

    desc: Dense urban environment - more suitable for mappers with some experience. MSF teams in this area of Port-au-Prince are addressing threats of dengue, chikungunya, cholera and zika and the project is in need of geographic data for several components, including water and sanitation activities (spraying, larviciding, fumigation in order to kill mosquitoes and larva), identification of larva sites in streets and at community level, entomologic surveillance, health promotion to sensitise and inform local people and cholera surveillance. The maps produced will support decision making processes, support population estimates and serve to communicate and plan activities.

    desc: NOTE. Not for beginners. Due to the amount already mapped here, this is unsuitable for mapping in iD. Please only map in JOSM.
