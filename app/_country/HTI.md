    desc: NOTE. Not for beginners. Due to the amount already mapped here, this is unsuitable for mapping in iD. Please only map in JOSM. The American Red Cross is supporting the Haitian Red Cross to expand their community based disaster response and health efforts into new communities in the northern metropolitan Port au Prince area. The communities outlined are at significant exposure to seasonal and acute flooding risks and they lack access to basic health services, disaster preparedness plans and disaster response plans.
