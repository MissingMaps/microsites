     desc: Concern Worldwide is working with communities in Port au Prince to make sustainable improvements in poverty levels and mitigate against risks of conflict and disasters.  This collaborative project aims to enhance and provide more useful details to the maps available for Concern Worldwide and partners to reach areas most in need of assistance and to produce open source visualisations of the urban and rural environments that communities live and work in. The Aerial imagery is provided by Bing Imagery and by Cosmha, Cartong and OSM France as part of the UAV mission done in May 2014

The American Red Cross is supporting the Haitian Red Cross to expand their community based disaster response and health efforts into new communities in the northern metropolitan Port au Prince area. The communities outlined are at significant exposure to seasonal and acute flooding risks and they lack access to basic health services, disaster preparedness plans and disaster response plans.
