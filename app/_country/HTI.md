     desc: Opened for validation, low priority only to make the TM front page less confusing Buildings Only Hurricane Matthew a category 4 hurricane is likely to hit the south west part of Haiti in the next 24 hours. The storm is projected to cause "life threatening". "Impacts, such as outer rainbands and some initial tropical storm-force gusts could begin in Jamaica and Hispañola (particularly Haiti) as soon as Sunday night, and in eastern Cuba as soon as Monday. This could make preparations difficult. Over a foot of rainfall from Matthew may trigger life threatening flash floods and mudslides. In Haiti in particular, heavy rainfall could be catastrophic." This is the first task to map roads and existing villages and towns to enable a detailed risk assessment.

     desc: The Netherlands Red Cross is working with the Haiti Red Cross in the South-Eastern Part of the Country for improving water and sanitation, health and livelihoods. A program that constructed heckdams in four catchment areas proved succesfull and currently the Red Cross is looking into scaling up the project. To determine the areas that are potential for scaling up, we need to know exactly where people live.
