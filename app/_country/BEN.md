    desc: The Netherlands Red Cross is supporting Croix Rouge Benin to decrease the number of children under 5 suffering from waterborne and oro-fecal diseases in the boroughs of Kessounou and Zoungamé in Ouémé, Benin. One of the activities to achieve this is to perform field assessments that identify vulnerable people. Detailed maps of the project area are vital to properly undertake the assessment.  The Netherlands Red Cross will also start investing in a local OSM / HOT community in Benin and is seeking opportunities to provide the necessary training and resources where needed.
