     desc: The Netherlands Red Cross is supporting Croix Rouge Benin to decrease the number of children under 5 suffering from waterborne and oro-fecal diseases in the boroughs of Kessounou and Zoungamé in Ouémé, Benin. One of the activities to achieve this is to perform field assessments that identify vulnerable people. Detailed maps of the project area are vital to properly undertake the assessment.  The Netherlands Red Cross will also start investing in a local OSM / HOT community in Benin and is seeking opportunities to provide the necessary training and resources where needed. The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.
