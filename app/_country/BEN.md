     desc: The Peace Corps Rural Community Health program in Benin is requesting assistance inventorying buildings and roads. A more detailed basemap is needed for use in testing, treating and tracking cases of malaria in children under five years of age. The map data will be used by the local health structure to display malaria trends in this highly vulnerable population. This project is being conducted under the scope of Peace Corps' innovative PECADOM+/ProACT pilot.

     desc: The Netherlands Red Cross is supporting Croix Rouge Benin to decrease the number of children under 5 suffering from waterborne and oro-fecal diseases in the boroughs of Kessounou and Zoungamé in Ouémé, Benin. One of the activities to achieve this is to perform field assessments that identify vulnerable people. Detailed maps of the project area are vital to properly undertake the assessment.  The Netherlands Red Cross will also start investing in a local OSM / HOT community in Benin and is seeking opportunities to provide the necessary training and resources where needed. The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.

     desc: The Peace Corps in Benin, in collaboration with AIRS, is requesting assistance in building a better base map of Oroukayo. The data will be used by AIRS and local health workers to promote accurate spraying coverage during yearly IRS (Indoor Residual Spray) campaigns. The data will also be used for food security projects as well.  Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of the U.S. Department of State is providing the OpenStreetMap community access to updated satellite imagery services to help assist with humanitarian mapping. This task includes mapping buildings and roads and is great for beginners!
