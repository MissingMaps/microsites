     desc: This task is for verifying that the Managua metro area is mapped thoroughly for it's roads and other "main" features (rivers, water bodies, etc). And mapping missing things when encountered.
   - id: 551
     desc: This task is dedicated for the addition of the "non duplicate" places. So don't use this for adding the duplicate locations (that need special attention in merging).

     desc: The purpose of this Country-Wide Base Mapping project is to systematically map all of Nicaragua for the basic map elements. This will be done with one Tasking Manager task for each department for the tracing of roads, rivers, lakes and notable ponds as well as by tracing the rough limits of urban settlements.

     desc: The Peace Corps program in Nicaragua is requesting assistance to inventory buildings and roads for a baseline map. This task will enable Peace Corps Nicaragua volunteers to train community members at their host sites in use of OSM.

     desc: Every year in the Americas more and more people are living in conditions of vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. To help reduce disaster risk and enhance community resilience in the region, the American Red Cross is working with Red Cross partners in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean to address local hazards and vulnerabilities in dozens of disaster-prone communities.  This initiative began with a Red Cross-led assessment process in which communities themselves identified the most significant risks they face and the actions they can take to mitigate them. Some examples of community interventions include strengthening water and sanitation systems, delivering key messages about health promotion and disease prevention, and training and equipping community members with first aid skills and supplies. In addition to addressing specific hazards, another key program component is working with communities so they are able to self-organize and self-manage advocacy or education efforts that will help them be better prepared for future disasters. The American Red Cross is also helping strengthen the capacity of Red Cross partners in the region to deliver services to communities. There is currently very little data for the area and there is a strong need for a more detailed basemap data (buildings, roads, land features, rivers) to assist with program operations and decision making.
