     desc: The border regions of West Africa were badly hit by the recent Ebola epidemic and remain particularly vulnerable. As part of ongoing response efforts, the American Red Cross and its partners are conducting rapid field mapping of all communities within 15 kilometres of the international borders shared between Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone – focusing on water, sanitation, health, and public amenities in each community. The fieldwork is being carried out by volunteers on motorbikes, equipped with a smartphone app (OpenMapKit) and other technical tools. To facilitate and help plan these field efforts, we are asking for assistance tracing roads, communities, and buildings.

     desc: In this area, MSF operations address infant and maternal mortality. To develop a strong community-based component for these health activities, field teams need reliable data on the location of settlements and population numbers. It is also important for health surveillance activities, so that teams can identify where people are worst affected. Teams on the ground will also gather information on health facilities, road networks and access (for referral and supply systems), and border crossing points and routes. This will enhance the MSF's capacity for epidemiological surveillance, especially with regard to haemorrhagic fever cases, in the area.

     desc: MSF began supporting reproductive and child health service provision at Magburaka Government Hospital in 2016. The team is currently developing a strategy to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity associated with delays in accessing and receiving obstetric care. Reliable maps of the town will allow them to implement health behaviour surveys, leading to better information and outcomes for patients.
