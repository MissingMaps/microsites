     desc: This is a private job to manage the import of the GNS place names file for village names.  Only people who have been trained in properly importing this data will be granted access to this job, in order to prevent people from misunderstanding the procedures.  These village names will be used by medical teams trying to locate people who may be infected with the Ebola virus, and to do what they call "contact tracing", which is the process of determining all of the people who may have come into contact with someone who already has the disease.

     desc: In this area, MSF operations address infant and maternal mortality. To develop a strong community-based component for these health activities, field teams need reliable data on the location of settlements and population numbers. It is also important for health surveillance activities, so that teams can identify where people are worst affected. Teams on the ground will also gather information on health facilities, road networks and access (for referral and supply systems), and border crossing points and routes. This will enhance the MSF's capacity for epidemiological surveillance, especially with regard to haemorrhagic fever cases, in the area.  The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.

     desc: Project for coordination by a team from Arup, but this also open for anyone to join in with. Finish off buildings in Freetown, Bo and Makeni in Sierra Leone, for disaster risk assessment

     desc: Due to heavy rains and flooding, a mudslide in the capital city of Freetown, Sierra Leone, killed over 300 people with that number expected to rise in the coming days. It is estimated that over 6,000 people have been displaced. Due to previous mapping efforts in Freetown during the Ebola crisis, the most heavily impacted areas have been thoroughly mapped. Continued rains could cause additional flooding and displacement in the coming days and weeks.
