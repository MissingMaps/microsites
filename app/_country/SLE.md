     desc: In this area, MSF operations address infant and maternal mortality. To develop a strong community-based component for these health activities, field teams need reliable data on the location of settlements and population numbers. It is also important for health surveillance activities, so that teams can identify where people are worst affected. Teams on the ground will also gather information on health facilities, road networks and access (for referral and supply systems), and border crossing points and routes. This will enhance the MSF's capacity for epidemiological surveillance, especially with regard to haemorrhagic fever cases, in the area.  The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.

     desc: Sierra Leone has among the highest child mortality rate and the highest maternal mortality ratio in the world. An already dysfunctional national health system was further weakened by the Ebola outbreak through loss of life amongst health staff. Within this, Kenema District has the highest child mortality rate. MSF is soon to open a project to reduce under 5 and maternal morbidity / mortality through supporting medical activities covered in the national policy for the free health care initiative, targeting the isolated chiefdoms of Gorama Mende / Wandor in Kenema District. The goal is to offer access to maternal and child health services in a remote, rural locality to work on how to increase the pickup of services in the communities. A detailed chiefdom mapping will highly help our achievement of this objective.

     desc: Due to heavy rains and flooding, a mudslide in the capital city of Freetown, Sierra Leone, killed over 300 people with that number expected to rise in the coming days. It is estimated that over 6,000 people have been displaced. Due to previous mapping efforts in Freetown during the Ebola crisis, the most heavily impacted areas have been thoroughly mapped. Continued rains could cause additional flooding and displacement in the coming days and weeks.
