    desc: In this area, MSF operations address infant and maternal mortality. To develop a strong community-based component for these health activities, field teams need reliable data on the location of settlements and population numbers. It is also important for health surveillance activities, so that teams can identify where people are worst affected. Teams on the ground will also gather information on health facilities, road networks and access (for referral and supply systems), and border crossing points and routes. This will enhance the MSF's capacity for epidemiological surveillance, especially with regard to haemorrhagic fever cases, in the area.
