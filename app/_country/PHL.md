   - desc: One year from the anniversary of Typhoon Haiyan, the <a href="http.//redcross.org">American Red Cross</a> and the <a href="http.//www.redcross.org.ph/">Philippine Red Cross</a> need better maps to plan and implement reconstruction programs for those affected. Despite over <a href="http.//resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-typhoon-haiyan-2013-contributors">1,600 mappers</a> making over <a href="http.//resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-typhoon-haiyan-2013#8/11.281/123.690">4.7 million edits</a> to OSM, many roads, fields, damaged homes, and other critical infrastructure remain unmapped in OpenStreetMap. In fact, many of the more remote communities covered by the reconstruction program are complete blank spots. This complicates efforts to repair or rebuild homes for the badly affected, provide them proper water and sanitation services and provide goods or skills for long-term economic success.

   - desc: The Philippine Red Cross, with partners including the American Red Cross, continues Typhoon Haiyan recovery operations in Leyte. They will use the more accurate and complete data of these areas in the management and monitoring of their programs. The Philippines is regularly subject to natural disasters such as typhoons and earthquakes, and the data will also support preparedness initiatives and future disaster responses.   Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of the U.S. Department of State is providing the OpenStreetMap community access to updated satellite imagery services to help assist with humanitarian mapping.
