    desc: The Philippine Red Cross, with partners including the American Red Cross, continues Typhoon Haiyan recovery operations in Leyte. They will use the more accurate and complete data of these areas in the management and monitoring of their programs. The Philippines is regularly subject to natural disasters such as typhoons and earthquakes, and the data will also support preparedness initiatives and future disaster responses.   Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of the U.S. Department of State is providing the OpenStreetMap community access to updated satellite imagery services to help assist with humanitarian mapping.
