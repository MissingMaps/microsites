    desc: The Danish, Swiss and British Red Cross are working together to support the Guinea Red Cross (GRC) develop integrated, high quality programmes. The GRC's Reproductive Health and Rights Programme aims at improving knowledge, rights and access to reproductive health in the Labe region, with a focus on women and young people. Community volunteers and midwives are trained to provide access to reproductive and ante-natal care, and information on reproductive and community health. A baseline survey is about to be conducted, gathering data on knowledge of, and access to, reproductive health and rights. Data will be used to measure change throughout, and at the end of, the project.
