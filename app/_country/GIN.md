     desc: The Peace Corps Stomp Out Malaria program in Senegal is requesting assistance building a better base map of Khouleya. In collaboration with the Senegalese Ministry of Health, Peace Corps and Senegalese public health professionals will conduct a study to determine the importance of geographic proximity in malaria transmission. In other words, the team seeks to determine whether all members of a household should be preemptively treated for malaria if one member tests positive. The purpose of this task is to trace missing buildings and roads.
