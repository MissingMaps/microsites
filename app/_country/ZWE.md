    desc: These maps will be used to as part of an ongoing urban resilience project by the American Red Cross that focuses on disaster and disease prevention and mitigation. The American Red Cross will be doing on the ground mapping in partnership with the local Red Cross and volunteers to ground truth and add local data. For more information on the Missing Maps, visit www.missingmaps.org.

    desc: HIV treatment needs to continuously be available to HIV positive people as only a few days of interruption can lead to resistance development in a patient. Additionally, with time most patients became resistant regardless of how well they take their treatment and in order to survive they need to switch to more modern forms of treatment that so far is largely unavailable. MSF is currently running a project in Epworth in the outskirts of Harare that is trying to address these problems by trying more accurate methods of measuring treatment efficiency and ensuring treatment adherence. Epworth is a slum with a highly mobile population and a continuous challenge is to trace patients that have missed appointments or that have been found to have abnormal test results that need to be addressed. To have an up-to-date map of the area would greatly facilitate our work.

    desc: Please follow instructions regarding mapping roads in this task. Annual flooding and recurring drought have devastating impacts on communities in Southern Africa. In the Zambezi River basin, seasonal weather patterns often result in crop failure, shelter damage, livestock death, soil erosion and increased water and sanitation issues.  Since late 2011, the American Red Cross has been working with communities in Binga district, Zimbabwe to identify and mitigate common hazards, as well as implement small-scale resilience projects such as latrine construction to improve household hygiene and building fuel-efficient cookstoves to reduce environmental degradation. At the same time, the American Red Cross is strengthening the capacity of the Zimbabwe Red Cross through trainings and community contingency planning support.

    desc: This project supports Médecins Sans Frontières’ operation in Mwenzei, Zimbabwe. The MSF team and their cartographer in the field are using maps to plan their operations. MSF needs a map displaying medical outreach points, health facilities and other relevant information in order to distribute viral loads and tuberculosis medication within the district. The map will also be useful to plan the setting up of mobile clinics in areas that may need support. MSF is already using field data collection tools and applications such as OSMAnd in the remote areas they’re travelling to. However, the road network for the district has hardly been mapped at all. Having a complete map of the road network in the district will therefore not only facilitate the planning of MSF activities via custom maps, but also all the organizations working in the area.
