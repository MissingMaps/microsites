    desc: This project supports Médecins Sans Frontières’ operation in Mwenzei, Zimbabwe. The MSF team and their cartographer in the field are using maps to plan their operations. MSF needs a map displaying medical outreach points, health facilities and other relevant information in order to distribute viral loads and tuberculosis medication within the district. The map will also be useful to plan the setting up of mobile clinics in areas that may need support. MSF is already using field data collection tools and applications such as OSMAnd in the remote areas they’re travelling to. However, the road network for the district has hardly been mapped at all. Having a complete map of the road network in the district will therefore not only facilitate the planning of MSF activities via custom maps, but also all the organizations working in the area.
