    desc: Please follow instructions regarding mapping roads in this task. Annual flooding and recurring drought have devastating impacts on communities in Southern Africa. In the Zambezi River basin, seasonal weather patterns often result in crop failure, shelter damage, livestock death, soil erosion and increased water and sanitation issues.  Since late 2011, the American Red Cross has been working with communities in Binga district, Zimbabwe to identify and mitigate common hazards, as well as implement small-scale resilience projects such as latrine construction to improve household hygiene and building fuel-efficient cookstoves to reduce environmental degradation. At the same time, the American Red Cross is strengthening the capacity of the Zimbabwe Red Cross through trainings and community contingency planning support.
