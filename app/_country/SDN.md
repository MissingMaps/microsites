    desc: Médecins Sans Frontières is opening a new operation in the city of Bazora in the State of Gedaref, Sudan. MSF's team will need a better map of the settlements and roads in the area in order to find their way in this remote area and reach the vulnerable populations that live there. There is no freely available mapping data available for the province, aside from that which has been already generously contributed by the OSM community until now.
