     desc: Since 2011, the Syrian crisis has caused a massive displacement of the population. The UN estimates over half of the population is desperately seeking refuge; many have escaped to neighbouring countries, but many more remain as internally displaced persons (IDP) in Syria. Humanitarian aid organisations need base maps to understand the geography in which they operate and better assess the emergency needs of the people. The areas of Al Tal, Qudsiya, and East Ghouta reportedly host an important number of IDPs at risk of suffering from inhumane conditions. The purpose of mapping these areas is to provide humanitarian organisations with material they can use for operations and operational research.  This project is more suitable for experienced mappers due to very high building density. If you are an experienced mapper, please spend some of your time on this project. The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises. disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.
