Plus particulièrement on cartographie dans la région de la ville de Faya-Largeau le chef-lieu du département de Borkou.

Les routes, les terres agricoles, les points d’eau sont contaminées par des mines ou des restes d’explosifs de guerre. Toutes les zones infectées nuisent au développement économique de la région.  Le projet initié par Handicap International se déroulera sur 4 ans sur tout le nord du Tchad pour réduire les risques liés aux mines et autres engins explosifs. Outre le projet de déminage, Handicap International, entreprend de mettre en place un volet social, qui vise à garantir aux personnes les plus vulnérables (personne en situation de handicap) un accès aux soins par des mécanismes de protections sociales. Enfin, le projet a aussi une visée économique ; des projets collectifs seront financés, par exemple l’irrigation d’une palmeraie, après qu’elle sera déminée afin de lancer la culture de dattes.","status":"PUBLISHED","country":"TCD"},{"projectId":4199,"name":"Lake Chad Region","campaignTag":null,"percentMapped":25,"percentValidated":3,"created":"2018-02-20T19:24:12.206225","lastUpdated":"2018-03-22T20:03:33.333800","aoiCentroid":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[14.3260552617894,13.4265457896431]},"mapperLevel":"BEGINNER","organisationTag":"USAID","shortDescription":"This project will focus on the islands of Chad’s Lac region, part of the greater Lake Chad basin.

The Kedougou Health Ministry hopes to use an improved map of the region to work with health facilities to track NGO presence as well as create visuals of trends/hot spots relating to disease burden, including malaria and malnutrition. Farmers are interested in using maps to track cashew farms and trainings. Maps can also help expand waste management businesses by determining the best routes for waste collection. Additionally, Kedougou is home to many beautiful waterfalls, attracting tourists all throughout the year. Eco-tourism businesses, such as hotels or tour guides, can benefit from a map of the communities they work in.

Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics(BBS) is the only national Statistical institution responsible for collecting, compiling and disseminating statistical data of all the sectors of the Bangladesh economy to meet and provide the data-needs of the users and stakeholders, like national level planners and other agencies of the Govt. Under the auspices of the computer wing of BBS, a development project entitled \"Strengthening Capacity of BBS in Population and Demographic Data Collection Using GIS\" is being implemented. The objective is to prepare digital enumeration area maps for conducting various censuses and surveys, aiming to reduce non-sampling errors. In this regard the self-supported easy and low cost geo data gathering tool “OpenStreetMap” can be a good option for collecting GIS data at field level. Under the business area of Supporting Poor Inclusive Sector Reform, WSP, World Bank Bangladesh, along with other WSP offices, has successfully organized two Hackathon with community of sanitation and water and ICT experts in order to identify and develop ICT solutions to water and sanitation-related challenges confronting developing country Bangladesh.  WSP provides technical assistance, facilitates knowledge exchange, and promotes evidence-based advancements in sector dialogue. WSP team warmly delivered the OpenStreetMap knowledge to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics for their Demographic Data Collection Using GIS project. Now, WSP Bangladesh and BBS want to do a piloting for Household level data collection along with other features in two unions of Singair upazila of Manikganj District. If it is successful for BBS's easy data base creation then it will be replicated all over Bangladesh. The field validation will be done after completing the remote mapping with this task.","status":"PUBLISHED","country":"BGD"},{"projectId":1816,"name":"Missing Maps : DRR programs in Ghogadaha Union, Kurigram Sadar Upazila, Kurigram District, Bangladesh","campaignTag":"Missing Maps","percentMapped":100,"percentValidated":4,"created":"2016-04-20T13:37:38.680098","lastUpdated":"2018-03-05T16:15:54.584325","aoiCentroid":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[89.7237127548791,25.8446123283085]},"mapperLevel":"BEGINNER","organisationTag":null,"shortDescription":"Due to recurrent flood in the Saheber Alga Union in Bangladesh, knowing the area and so having reliable OSM datas will  incredibly help in organizing help.

To help reduce disaster risk and enhance community resilience in the region, the American Red Cross is working with Red Cross partners in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean to address local hazards and vulnerabilities in dozens of disaster-prone communities.  This initiative began with a Red Cross-led assessment process in which communities themselves identified the most significant risks they face and the actions they can take to mitigate them. Some examples of community interventions include strengthening water and sanitation systems, delivering key messages about health promotion and disease prevention, and training and equipping community members with first aid skills and supplies. In addition to addressing specific hazards, another key program component is working with communities so they are able to self-organize and self-manage advocacy or education efforts that will help them be better prepared for future disasters. The American Red Cross is also helping strengthen the capacity of Red Cross partners in the region to deliver services to communities. There is currently very little data for the area and there is a strong need for a more detailed basemap data (buildings, roads, land features, rivers) to assist with program operations and decision making.","status":"PUBLISHED","country":"NIC"},{"projectId":1617,"name":"Missing Maps: Nicaragua #2 - Resilience in the Americas #28","campaignTag":"Missing Maps","percentMapped":100,"percentValidated":0,"created":"2016-03-04T20:50:35.068387","lastUpdated":"2017-10-18T22:01:21.380177","aoiCentroid":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.0289734734526,12.5493183508428]},"mapperLevel":"BEGINNER","organisationTag":"American Red Cross","shortDescription":"Every year in the Americas more and more people are living in conditions of vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change.

To better understand what structures might be impacted by hazards such as earthquakes and floods, and how people and goods move about during a disaster, there is a clear need to improve our understanding of the built infrastructure in Karonga.

This initiative began with a Red Cross-led assessment process in which communities themselves identified the most significant risks they face and the actions they can take to mitigate them. Some examples of community interventions include strengthening water and sanitation systems, delivering key messages about health promotion and disease prevention, and training and equipping community members with first aid skills and supplies. In addition to addressing specific hazards, another key program component is working with communities so they are able to self-organize and self-manage advocacy or education efforts that will help them be better prepared for future disasters. The American Red Cross is also helping strengthen the capacity of Red Cross partners in the region to deliver services to communities.

An important element of this task requires that JOSM validator is run each time a tile is selected to correct errors from previous mapping attempts.","status":"PUBLISHED","country":"LSO"},{"projectId":3849,"name":"#MapLesotho Phase 4 - Quthing Camptown","campaignTag":"Phase4","percentMapped":25,"percentValidated":0,"created":"2017-11-16T01:22:46.813716","lastUpdated":"2017-12-09T21:18:22.180852","aoiCentroid":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[27.7011607769266,-30.4029502361281]},"mapperLevel":"INTERMEDIATE","organisationTag":"MapLesotho","shortDescription":"Provide a limited focus area for hyper detailed mapping in locations that are urban, and growing fast in a Lesotho context, or have national infrastructure and development.
